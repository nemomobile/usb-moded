USB_MODED use and API description/overview.
==========================================

Usb_moded is a relatively simple daemon which tracks the
usb cable connection status and activates a certain USB
profile based on that.
To do this it has a number of built in common profiles, 
an optional application launcher (app_sync) and configurable
dynamic modes.

All the system wide communication goes over the DBus system bus,
while application launching is handled on the session bus.
Thus if you need this functionality, usb_moded needs to be started 
with the session. 
(functionality not verified yet on multi-user setups. See TODO)

Usb cable detection is supported by several different methods.
Old deprecated hal, through Nokia's own battery monitoring bme, 
or the preferred udev option. (This has to be chosen at compile time)

Starting usb_moded
-------------------

Simply start with usb_moded.
usb_moded --help will give you more details

Status and configuration query/setting
---------------------------------------

The current status can be queried any time over DBus. From a program
using a method call or using dbus-send.

dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.meego.usb_moded /com/meego/usb_moded com.meego.usb_moded.mode_request

Similary a mode can be set.

dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.meego.usb_moded /com/meego/usb_moded com.meego.usb_moded.set_mode string:'<mode_name>'

Even the configuration can be set over DBus (this will set either the gconf key or use the settings file)

dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.meego.usb_moded /com/meego/usb_moded com.meego.usb_moded.set_config string:'<mode_name>'

To get the currently stored default mode from the config:

dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.meego.usb_moded /com/meego/usb_moded com.meego.usb_moded.get_config

The supported modes can be queried over dbus as follows:

dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.meego.usb_moded /com/meego/usb_moded com.meego.usb_moded.get_modes

=== WITH GCONF ONLY === 

However this can also be optionally handled by setting the following GConf key (gconf has to be compiled in).

/Meego/System/UsbMode (querying and setting can be done as follows:

gconftool-2 -g /Meego/System/UsbMode
gconftool-2 -s /Meego/System/UsbMode --type=string <mode_name>

=== END WITH GCONF ONLY === 

Usb_moded will also broadcast changes and errors over the system bus.
This will happen on the com.meego.usb_moded interface

For regular signals: sig_usb_state_ind
And errors: sig_usb_state_error_ind

More info and details in usb_moded-dbus.h

There is also a configuration file and some configuration directories under /etc/usb-moded
It should have some pre-filled fields for the default mass-storage profile

The first one would be mountpoints, this defines which device/filesystem entry should be 
exported over mass-storage (this ideally also has an entry in /etc/fstab). You can add more 
filesystems to the mount option, by making it a comma-seperated list in case there are 
several exports (like internal mmc and sd card for example)

[mountpoints]
mount = /dev/mmcblk0p1

The following option plays with certain sync options that exist and have to be set per
fs and thus cannot be handled by setting them in /etc/modprobe.d/....conf

[sync]
nofua = 1

This mount is the alternative mountpoint for in case something goes wrong. Usb_moded
will mount a 512 RO tmpfs on that location to mitigate potential disasters on the system,
and make clear to programs on the device that something is wrong with the fs they want to use.

[altmount]
mount = /home/user/MyDocs

Also the default usb mode can be configured there. For example:

[usbmode]
mode = ask

The other settings and config dirs will be handled later in the appsync and dynamic modes part.
(This is optional and can be compiled out)

There is also an optional network configuration. The default ip set for usb networking is 192.168.2.15 
(for Meego/Nemo). However this can be configured by hand in the ini file also.
For example:

[network]
ip = 10.0.0.2
interface = usb1
gateway = 10.0.0.1

By default usb0 will be used, so no need to fill it in if not needed. The gateway setting is also optional
and will not be set if there is no value filled in.
If the ip is set to dhcp, usb_moded will try to use dhcp to configure the network (requires dhclient atm)

The network configuration can also be set with dbus method calls via the net_config method.
This requires two strings as arguments. Supported are: ip, interface and gateway

for exmaple:

dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.meego.usb_moded /com/meego/usb_moded com.meego.usb_moded.net_config string:'ip' string:'192.168.2.15'

Usb_moded will generate a random mac address for the g_ether driver. Thus when plugging in the device repeatedly the mac address will not
change and udev rules / network manager etc will not think it is a new device each time.
This mac is stored using the default modprobe configuration and thus will be in /etc/modprobe.d/g_ether.conf
If this file exits usb_moded will assume there is a default mac set and will not do anything.

It is possible to set the configuration on the kernel command line also. For this the regular ip setting from the kernel is
being re-used. 

The format followed is:
ip=<client-ip>:<server-ip>:<gw-ip>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<device>:<autoconf>

For more info see the kernel source: Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt

for example : ip=192.168.3.100::192.168.3.1:255.255.255.0::usb0:off

NOTE: The device must be usb0! The autoconf value is ignored.

Functional overview
--------------------

When a usb cable is insertion is detected usb_moded will start to act.
First it will warn on the system bus that a cable is connected. 
Then it will check what the configuration setting is. Thus it knows how to act.
If it is a known configured mode it will load the correct modules (after checking 
what is loaded and clean up if needed), perform other needed operations and
make sure the chosen mode works. At this point it will broadcast which mode 
is set to warn other programs.
If things fail it will go to undefined state (and also broadcast this).

There is the special case where the config option is called "ask". In this
case usb_moded will enable a fake mass_storage profile to enable enumeration 
so charging can be done, and wait until it is instructed which mode needs
to be selected. Thus this state can be used for an UI that will set the right
mode on user interaction. For this purpose usb_moded broadcasts it goes in ask
mode, and also stays in ask mode until a chosen mode is requested or the cable
is disconnected. This also avoids race conditions in case the  UI starts
after a cable is inserted and usb_moded has also been started. The UI can then 
query the state to know if it needs to show a selection dialog or not.

On cable disconnect usb_moded will broadcast a disconnect signal, so that all programs
that use the usb interface/mode know that a cable is disconnected and then can act
(if needed) on the changed situation. It will then do all the necessary to reset
the system to a clean state.

Another special feature is the dedicated charger tracking. When a charger is connected
usb_moded will broadcast a charger_connected signal and go to "dedicated charger" mode.
This is just a place-holder mode. On charger disconnect then there will be a 
charger_disconnected signal.

Appsync feature
---------------

In case you need some program to be started along some mode the appsync option 
provides this option.
Only condition is that it can be activated by dbus and that (preferably) it will
notify usb_moded that it is ready by ready_method call on the session bus.
Systemd and upstart are also supported.
This ready method call is just calling the regular usb_moded interface, but now
on the session bus, with as argument the program name as defined in the config file.

To achieve this you need to have a config file in /etc/usb-moded/run.
Best practice would be giving it a descriptive name followed by .ini

For example:
/etc/usb-moded/run/foo.ini

Where foo.ini would be for dbus:
[info]
name = foo
mode = foo_mode
launch = com.meego.foo

For systemd it would be as follows:
[info]
name = foo.service
mode = foo_mode
systemd = 1

The name here is the service name used when launching it for example with systemctl

For upstart:
[info]
name = foo
mode = foo_mode
upstart = 1

Here the name is service name used by upstart.

Those files will be read on start and usb_moded will keep a list of apps to launch 
for a certain mode. This also means that if you change the files or add/remove some
you need to restart usb_moded. Later when the mode is activated, usb_moded will start 
each of them after the module has been loaded and keep track if they have been started.
It will warn you if that failed. This works together with an optional softconnect option
that will need kernel support.

Dynamic modes
-------------

Apart from ask and charging_only modes, all modes for usb_moded are defined
within configuration files. These are to be defined with an ini file alsoi, but this time in 
/etc/usb-moded/dyn-modes.

The format would be for example for : /etc/usb-moded/dyn-modes/dyn-mode-1.ini

[mode]
name = dyn-mode-1
module = dyn-mode-module
appsync = 1
network = 1
network_interface = usb0

[options]
sysfs_path = /* in case you need to echo parameters somewhere in a sysfs path */
sysfs_value = /* the values */
sysfs_reset_value = /* in case a reset value needs to be written */
softconnect_path = /* a path in case the module needs activation with a softconnect option */
softconnect = /* value to be written to enable */
softconneci_disconnect = /* value to be written for disable */

Only the mode name and module are mandatory. In case you do not use modules, use none as the value 
for module (as for the android gadget for example. See the android section for more info)

If appsync or network is not defined, or explicitly set to 0, it will not be used.
To use the mass_storage functions you need to define mass_storage = 1. The needed info for
mass_storage data need to be defined in the config file. (other approaches are possible so this is not
mandatory for all kinds of mass_storage support)

Trigger support
---------------

This will only work if udev is configured as it is a udev trigger.
Atm only one trigger is supported.
This is to support special equipment that will send a trigger event.
Usually this will be in combination with a dynamic mode.

You need to add the following to usb-moded.ini to get a trigger activated

For example

[trigger]
path = /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc
udev_subsystem = platform
mode = mass_storage
property = TRIGGER_CMD

Android gadget driver support
-----------------------------

A number of configurations are already supported out of the box for android. They
just need to be installed in the right spot to work.

In the main configuration file a few extras can be configured for all modes.

An android extra section in the main configuration file would look like this:

[android]
iManufacturer = foo-factory
idVendor = 0666 /* this is the vendor id code in hex */
iProduct = awesome-device
idProduct = 0001 /* If you decide to use one Product id for all the supported modes. Not recommended if you will connect it to Windows machines */

A mode configuration would look like this: 

[mode]
name = developer_mode
module = none
network = 1
network_interface = rndis0

[options]
sysfs_path = /sys/class/android_usb/android0/functions
sysfs_value = rndis
sysfs_reset_value = none
softconnect_path = /sys/class/android_usb/android0/enable
softconnect = 1
softconnec_disconnect = 0
idProduct = 0002

rescue mode
-----------

When started with -r usb_moded will always enable developer mode (networking)
if it can. This is a debug feature and should not be used in production software.

Turning it off when the device is booted completely can easily be done over dbus.

dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.meego.usb_moded /com/meego/usb_moded com.meego.usb_moded.rescue_off

config files and config file merging
------------------------------------

The main config file for usb_moded is /etc/usb-moded/usb-moded.ini

If this does not exist usb_moded will create one for you, which will default
to setting up a default network with ip 192.168.2.15 and uses the g_ether module.

The different sections of the config file can be split out in different ini files,
however take into account usb_moded will need to be restarted to merge these in a 
new usb-moded.ini file. As usb_moded will check if new files were added to the /etc/usb-moded
directory and refresh the main ini file as needed on start-up.

diagnostic mode
---------------

Usb-moded supports a diagnostic mode. This requires a special command line parameter (-d).
One mode should be configured in /etc/usb-moded/diag and this will be automatically used.
This is a feature to allow for "hidden" or non-standard modes that are only of use for 
testing/QA.
